# Research Project Template

This repository serves as a template for research projects.

## Dependencies

All the experiments were performed using Python 3.9. In order to create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies you can run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code organization

The directory [src](src/) contains the source code for the experiments.

The directory [scripts](scripts/) contains bash scripts that use the aforementioned code and pass parameter values required for the various experiments.

The directory [notebooks](notebooks/) contains jupyter notebooks producing the figures appearing in the paper. Each notebook reads output files which first need to be generated by executing the corresponding script of the same name.

The directory [figures](figures/) is used for saving the figures produced by the notebooks.

The directory [outputs](outputs/) is used for saving the json outputs produced by the scripts.
