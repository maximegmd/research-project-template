## Introduction

One paragraph motivating the project. This can be, for example, the paper abstract.

## Dependencies

### python
All the experiments were performed using Python 3.9. In order to create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies you can run the following commands:

*The current `requirements.txt` contains commonly used packages. Remember to run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` before publishing the project.*

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### julia
All the experiments were performed using Julia 1.11.3. In order to create a project and install its dependencies you can open the Julua REPL (by running `julia`) and run the following commands:

*The current `Project.toml` contains commonly used packages. Remember to also commit `Manifest.toml` before publishing the project.*

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
or equivalently
```julia
] activate .
] instantiate
```

```

- `configs` contains json files that specify the parameter values of each experiment
- `data` contains data and processed configuration files for our experiments.
- `figures` contains all the figures presented in the paper.
- `notebooks` contains python notebooks to generate all the figures included in the paper.
- `outputs` contains intermediate output files generated by the experiments' scripts.
- `scripts` contains a set of scripts used to run all the experiments presented in the paper. 
- `src` contains all the code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper. Specifically:
  - `executor.py` reads parameter values from a config file and passes them to `blah.py` or `blah.jl`
  - `blah.py` is a `python` experiment script.
  - `blah.jl` is a `julia` experiment script.
  - `utils.py` contains auxiliary functions for plotting.
